DISCLAIMER:
This ontology includes numerous SKOS mappings to the following ontologies and thesauri where possible:
SnoMed, BFO, DOLCE, SUMO, STY, FMA, Gufo, UFO. Note that these mappings can not be represented in this documentation.

The VPH contains many 'rdfs:seeAlso' properties that refer to classes in VPH that may look similar but point to different concepts. This property is also used to refer to classes needed for instantiating several ontology design patterns.  Unfortunately, this information can not be represented in this documentation. 

To access all information currently incorporated in VPH, we therefore refer to VPH.owl. Note that the ontology is very much work-in-progress and not yet axiomatized.</span>
